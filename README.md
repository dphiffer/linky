# The Whale

Moby Dick serialized into tiny texts, created as a coding exercise for a course I’m teaching this semester.

## Text from Project Guttenberg

The text is a slightly modified version of [Project Gutenberg’s](http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2701/pg2701.txt). I deleted the Sub-Sub-Librarian introductory text and converted double-hyphens into em-dashes.

## Preparing the .txt files

Run `whale.php` to break `whale.txt` into tiny text files. There is also a [zip file archive](http://phiffer.org/whale/whale.zip) available.

## Design based on BOIYNB

The text treatment is based on [Mat Honan’s](http://www.honan.net/) iconic [Barack Obama Is Your New Bicycle](http://barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com/).

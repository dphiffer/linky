# Linky (previously: The Whale)

This project began as a coding exercise for a course I’m teaching this semester, serializing Moby Dick serialized into tiny texts. I’ve since renamed and expanded the project to include other source texts.

## Texts from Project Gutenberg

* [Moby Dick; Or, The Whale](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701) by Herman Melville
* [Le Morte D’Arthur](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1251) by Thomas Malory

The source texts have been slightly modified prior to breaking them into many smaller text files. For example, I’ve deleted introductory and preface text and converted double-hyphens into em-dashes.

## Preparing the .txt files

Run `linky.php` to break a source into tiny text files.

## Design based on BOIYNB

The text treatment is based on [Mat Honan’s](http://www.honan.net/) iconic [Barack Obama Is Your New Bicycle](http://barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com/).
